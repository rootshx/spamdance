# spamdance
A simple macro script that automates the dance feature in League of Legends by pressing Ctrl + 3 repeatedly with the press of ThumbMouse2 (X2). The dance can be stopped by pressing any key (except Space) or right-clicking. It helps users perform the dance more easily without having to manually press the keys multiple times.
